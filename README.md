# Matplotlib Project
## Overview
This repo contains a jupyter notebook analysis of two .csv files of hypothetical study results for novel cancer treatments trialled on mice.

The notebook reads in the .csv files and performs a range of descriptive and inferential statistical plots using matplotlib.pyplot, including:
- A pd merge of both datasets
- Summary charts of drug regimens by number of interventions
- plots distribution of tumor volumen by drug type, as well as noting potential outliers.
- a regression model of mouse weight vs tumor volume

A written analysis of findings is provided at the top of the notebook.
